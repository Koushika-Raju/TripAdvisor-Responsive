# TripAdvisor-Responsive

📱 This project is a mobile‑responsive clone of the TripAdvisor homepage, built purely with semantic HTML and modular CSS.

🔧 The layout relies on Flexbox for fluid positioning of the header, navigation menu, and content cards.

📐 Media queries at 1200px, 768–1199px, and ≤546px ensure the design adapts seamlessly from desktop to small‑screen mobile.

📌 A sticky header remains visible on scroll and collapses menu items on narrow viewports for streamlined navigation.

🔍 The “Where to?” search bar features a fully CSS‑styled, rounded input and button without any JavaScript.

🎞️ Hero and content sections use CSS keyframe animations to rotate images and fade in text automatically.

✨ Smooth hover effects on buttons, images, and links enhance interactivity and user engagement.

🎨 Font Awesome icons and the Google “Gabarito” font deliver crisp visuals and consistent typography.

🗂️ All assets are organized in an /images folder, making it easy to swap or customize visuals.

🚀 This repository demonstrates modern, responsive web design techniques without external frameworks.
